## Main Contribution of the EHRs Data Curation Platform

The main contribution of our EHRs data curation platform is the reproducibility and shareability of the result. In the “derived variables description” tab, valuable information about the derived variable we created is stored. Also, the details sheet that we created has essential information about the changes we made to the dataset. Both of these spreadsheets are available to download and share with others. 

Other users only need to upload the details sheet, connect to a “derived variables library” which is a repository of all derived variables that are created and verified by other researchers (with the same structure of the spreadsheet available in the “derived variables description” tab), select their required derived variables, and reproduce a curated dataset. Additionally, users can modify and update existing work with this approach.

To reproduce a work, after connecting/uploading your original database:

1. In the details sheet tab, upload an existing details sheet.
2. In the sidebar panel, after selecting “yes” for derived variable, choose to select a derived variable from a derived variable library (DVL), enter the path to it, and select your preferred derived variables.
3. Click on the “recode the dataset” button to reproduce the curation work.

  <p>As soon as a derived variable (that needs a custom function) is added to the details sheet, the variables’ name, components, function name, and function code will be saved in the “Derived variable description” tab. This spreadsheet can be downloaded and used to create/update a derived variables library.</p>
