## Example Usages with the Paquid Dataset

In this section, weâ€™ll show how the platform works by using it on the Paquid dataset of mental health records, publicly available within the `lcmm` R package on extended mixed models.

This Paquid dataset contains 2,250 observations (represented as rows in the dataset table) over 500 subjects and 12 variables (represented as columns in the dataset table). A patient can have multiple observations.

The variables include repeated cognitive measures (MMSE, IST, and BVRT psychometric tests), physical dependency (HIER), and depression symptomatology (CESD) collected over 20 years along with dementia information (age at dementia diagnosis, dementia diagnosis information) and time-independent socio-demographic information (CEP, male sex, initial age). This dataset has 726 missing values, which is 2.69% of the total data instances.
